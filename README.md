### Yes, this is the development code, not the build code
__But I did this on purpose.__ 

The kind of graphic design I like might not be for everyone. This way, the core code is hackable and modifiable. You can edit it to your hearts content.

I'm also working on refactoring the CSS to make it more readable and editable

__App icon and install.sh script are coming soon__
